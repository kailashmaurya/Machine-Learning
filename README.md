# Machine-Learning

Hi there!
<br>
You'll find here all the experiments or projects done by me using the Machine Learning Techniques/Algorithms.
<br><br>
I was fascinated by Machine Learning Algorithm and so I learned it from Coursera.org by none other than Andrew Ng and started experimenting with data.
<br><br>
You will find programs implemented in python with the help of numpy. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
<ul>
<li>a powerful N-dimensional array object</li>
<li>sophisticated (broadcasting) functions</li>
<li>tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code</li>
<li>useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities</li>
</ul>
<br>
Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
<br><br>
Also, some of the programs are implemented in Octave which is an open source alternative for MATLAB. It generates \*.m files same as MATLAB. It has powerful matrices library and visualization capabilities which speeds up in prototyping a project.
