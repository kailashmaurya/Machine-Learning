# Machine-Learning

Hi there!
<br>
You'll find here all the experiments or projects done by me using the Machine Learning Techniques/Algorithms.
<br><br>
I was fascinated by Machine Learning Algorithm and so I learned it from Coursera.org by none other than Andrew Ng and started experimenting with data.
<br><br>
The programs are written in Octave which is an open source alternative for MATLAB. It generates \*.m files same as MATLAB. It has powerful matrices library and visualization capabilities which speeds up in prototyping a project.
